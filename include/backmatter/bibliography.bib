	abstract="As you prepare to design your app and as you have begun to familiarize yourself with all of the principles of the Human Interface Guidelines and iOS 7, you undoubtedly have heard the phrase ``Flat Design'' bandied about. It is a term being used to define Apple's new direction to the user interface of the operating system. So, it's only fair to define flat design and to explain not only what it is and where it comes from, but also how you can use it to create your very own app. As you set out to create your app, think about the content and bringing that front and center. One thing to remember is that users have now been interacting with multi-touch and Apple's suite of mobile devices for some time now.",
